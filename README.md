# Project_2 - An analysis of Michael Jordan's and Shaquille O'Neal's careers to confirm who was the better player overall. The foundation data was created by another group in the course; we added more focused data that looked at the start and end of their careers to see if there was growth or consistancy for either player.  We also included an active up-and-coming backetball player to compare to their stats to prove as an example of how they would fair in today's game.
